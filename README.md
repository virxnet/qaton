# Qaton - The Elemental PHP MVC System

*** MVC so light, it's as fast as vanilla PHP! ***

*Qaton is a minimal lightweight super-fast MVC system. Qaton aims to be 
a small and insignificant foundation for apps, but it is certainly not 
another PHP framework (there are plenty of those out there). Qaton 
relies on pure PHP by default and can be easily extended. Flexible by 
design and armed with the absolute essentials such as routing, themes, 
multi-language etc...*

Sometimes you don't need a large bloated PHP framework for certain 
types of apps and websites. You just need some basic MVC to keep things 
organized and easy to maintain. You also don't want to lose any 
performance because of unnecessary overhead. You want something that is 
flexible but works right off the bat with zero-config, is lightning 
fast and easy to use. Qaton is the answer. Qaton is a tiny open source 
PHP MVC sysmem. Qaton will get you up and running in a flash. Qaton is 
not another PHP framework.

Qaton will not carry a large collection of tools and libraries. Rather, 
it can be easily extended using resources such as Packagist and 
Composer instead. Qaton is also easy to use with any headless CMS 
system.

Qaton is released under the MIT license.
