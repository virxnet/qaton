				<h2>Why Qaton?</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Sometimes you don't need a large bloated PHP framework for certain types of apps and websites. You just need some basic MVC to keep things organized and easy to maintain. You also don't want to lose any performance because of unnecessary overhead. You want something that is flexible but works right off the bat with zero-config, is lightning fast and easy to use. Qaton is the answer. Qaton is a tiny open source PHP MVC sysmem. Qaton will get you up and running in a flash. Qaton is not another PHP framework.</p>
				<p>Qaton will not carry a large collection of tools and libraries. Rather, it can be easily extended using resources such as Packagist and Composer instead. Qaton is also easy to use with any headless CMS system. </p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="<?php echo BASE_URL ?>docs#install">Get Qaton Now &raquo;</a>
